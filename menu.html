<center><b>Mission Statement</b></center>
<p>TIFERO is created as group project. The group of eight (named the Initiatives) came together to brainstorm on ways they can create something that would be beneficial to the society. TIFERO strive to help advance the knowledge about education and to help link people to opportunities that can be beneficial to the Nigerian youths. We also hope to create a platform with different opportunities on conferences and seminars happening around Nigeria can be conveyed. We also hope to create awareness on several development programs being organised by several organisation on different opportunities, be it vocational or technological skills. TIFERO aims to improve development through learning, by sharing consolidating knowledge tools and showcasing of different opportunities in different states to bring about oneness and also empower youth to have a stance in several technological aspects.</p><br>

<center><b>Our Vision</b></center> 
<p>TIFERO is hoping that our platform is to able and ensure that at least 90% of Nigerian men, women and children have access to quality educational information that could empower them to be productive to not only themselves, but to the society at large. We are hoping to be able to find better ways to find opportunities that empowers Nigerian youths and reduces the rate of youth unemployment in Nigeria. We are hoping to create a platform where several people with different vocational knowledge could sign up and get job opportunities and also be willing to share vital knowledge and tips to people within their field having any issue they can solve.</p><br>
